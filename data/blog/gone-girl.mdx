Gone girl, what does the title bring to your mind. A girl who has gone, quite simple right but there are so many underlying questions here. Where did she go? Why did she go? Was she forced to go or did she go willingly? These are the questions which the movie tries to unfold layer by layer. A movie adapted from the novel by Gillian Flynn with the same name is a neo-noir movie.

It starts with the main character Nick Dunne caressing his wife Amy's hair & talking about her in his mind in such a way that it makes the audience feel scared for her. Amy goes missing from their house on the day of their fifth wedding anniversary. As usual people & the media start speculating that Nick has something to do with Amy's sudden disappearance. The media tries to be the detective & tries to solve the mystery with its own theories & assumptions. It is a kind of a mockery by the writer on the role of the media in such cases. When the detectives investigate their house they find an envelope named "Clue 1". Which Nick explains is a "treasure hunt game" they used to play every year on their anniversary. It gives them an advantage to find her. We also get to know that Amy's parents had published a series of books with the name "Amazing Amy" which was actually a portrayal of the perfect version of the actual Amy. It was meant to hide her failures.

They both lose their jobs & they both deal with it in their own ways. Nick & Amy shift to Missouri from New York to take care of Nick's mother who had cancer. With the progress of the movie we see a complete breakdown of a marriage from Amy's perspective which she had written down in her diary. The diary is a very important part of the movie. They grow apart from each other & distant. Amy is so scared of her husband that she also buys a gun for safety. Nick isn't only the suspect for the people in the movie but also for the audience. His nonchalant attitude towards the disappearance of his wife seems a little suspicious. We also get to know about his affair which makes him more of a subject for suspicion.

# Spoiler Alert!

The main twist comes when we get to know that Amy is the one who had framed Nick. She had run away to a campground. Almost everyone in the audience am sure would start sympathizing with Nick at this point. Amy's plans though backfires when her campground mates rob her. Still being intelligent as she was she comes up with a backup plan & calls her ex boyfriend Desi to rescue her. Meanwhile her husband tries so many ways to come out of all this but soon gets to know about his wife's true motives & is left with no other choice but to ask for forgiveness in front of the whole media. Amy gets convinced that her old Nick is back & she plans to go back to him by killing Desi. At the end of the movie we get to know that Amy is pregnant & Nick has to stay with her for the rest of their life as a "happy" family even if he wants to leave her.

This movie with its shocking twists & turns is a must watch. It is a good portrayal of that dark side of a "loving relationship" which goes unnoticed by many of us. It shows the flaws of the upper middle class family. The main locus of the story is the issues within the family.
People might be thinking that Amy is such a cold hearted person to take such a revenge on Nick but ask this one question to yourself does he really deserve all these sympathy for himself?
